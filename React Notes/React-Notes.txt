---> What is React JS:-


---> Benifits of Using React:- 
  


---> npm and npx hum kab use kartey hai 
   --> npm tab use kartey hai jab hamara project pahle se ready rahta hai. 
   --> while npx hum use tab kartey hai jab new project setup cartey hai. 



---> What is differenec b/w package.json and package-lock.json:-
   --> package-lock.json app ki puri history sambhal kar rakhti hai sare module and Liberary.
   --> package.json ye hamari application ki details rakhti hai.



---> app.test.js isame unit test likhi jati hai testing team check karti hai bug wagairah.
---> index.js react ki entry point hoti hai.



---> What is component:
   --> Component is a piece of code that can re-use again and again.
   --> Example: function (Suppose ek name ka function banaye then isko reuse kar saktey hai).
   --> But more powerful than function (their own props, state).
   --> Example of component: Header, Footer
     


---> What is JSX:
   --> JSX is javascript XML that means to write HTML In javascript.
   --> Write HTML and javascript Together.
   --> Use Like HTML or XML tags.



---> What is State(Function Component):
     State is object hota hai jisme hum data ko store karte hai same as varibale



---> Use of State:
     Jab bhi hum variable use kartey hai toh hamara component update nahi hota hai
     and jab hum state use karte hai toh hamara component update or re-render hota hai.
     State hamara ek container jisme hum data ko store kartey hai simple.


---> Define of State: 
     State is object hota hai jisme hum data ko store karte same as varibale

    

---> update state with a Button Click:


---> How State work:


---> Interview Question:


---> State in Class Component:
    1. Make Class Component
    2. What is State: State is a Data Container Hota hai jisme name, value etc store kar saktye hai
    3. Define State
    4. update state with a Button Click


---> What is Props In Functional-Component:(v.v.i)
  -> Jaise hum kisi function ke under parameter pass kartey thik usi tarah hum component 
     ke under hum props pass kartey hai.
  -> props just like a parameter.
  -> props ka pura matlab Propertie hota hai.



  -> In React, props (short for "properties") are a way to pass data from a parent component to child component. Props are an object that contains a set of values that are passed to a component as attributes when it is rendered. The child component can then access these values through the props object.


---> What is Props In Class-Component:
    -> Jab ek component se kisi dusre Component mein data ko transfer karana hota hai then hum   
       props ka use kartey hai.
   
   -> Props just like a parameter.

---> JSX ko humlog Bina React ke bhi Use kar saktey by making .jsx extension



---> Life Cycle Method with Class Component in React:
   --> Types of Life Cycle Method
       1. Mounting
       2. Updating
       3. Unmounting
          

---> Life cycle Method kab apply hota hai 
   --> When Component is Loaded.
   --> when component is updated with props and state.
   --> When Componentis removed means hide ho jata tab.


--->Construtor
   Jab hum class ko call kartey then constructor apne aap hi call ho jata hai


---> what is Super Method:
     Parent Class ko call karne ke liye Super method use kartey hai.



---> What is Render() Method:
    1. render() Method means Uplod karna
    2. Execute Karke Represent karna.
    3. render() Method only we use in Class Component.
    4. render() is a life Cycle Method.



---> Why we use Rendrer() Method:



---> What is componentDidMount:
     kisi chij ko load kar rahe hai or Load ho raha hai toh Mounting.
     When our Component Load or Render then called componentDidMount().
 
 --> Use of componentDidMount:
    --> Iska use humlog tab kartey hai jab hum API Call kartey hai.

    --> componentDidMount tab chalta hai jab hamara HTML files ready ho chuka hoga.

    --> koee bhi aesa operation jisme humko hide show karwana ho toh hum componentDidMount ke under kartey hai.


   --> koee bhi aesa operation jo hamare HTML par depend ho toh componentDidMount ke under kartey hai.

   --> iska matlab hamara HTML ready hi nhi hai and API call kar diye then code kahi na kahi break ho sakta hai so we use componentDidMount method.


   --> Best Examaple of componentDidMount API call karna
      jab tak hamara HTML DOM sab Load ho chuka hoga.

   --> Did means ho chuka 
   
   --> API ko baar baar toh call karna nahi isliye componentDidMount method use kartey hai single time upload hota hai.
  


---> What is componentDidUpdte:
     1. when component is update that's called componentDidUpdted.
     2. componentDidUpdte state or props ke update ho par render hota hai.
     3. Suppose when click on button then print on console.


---> What is componentWillMount:
     1. Jab bhi component DOM se remove hoga then componentWillMount call hoga.
     2. Profits: Suppose API call kar rahe hai and immediately component ko remove karna hai toh us request ko cancel kar saktey hai.
     3. koee data loading ho rahi hai usko cancel kar saktey hai.
     4. koee function bhi call kar saktey hai.


---> What is ComponenetUpdate:
     1. By default ye component ko rendering nahi hone deta hai that means ye false return karta h.
     2. by default false return karta ek tarah se block kar deta hai.
     3. Iska mainly use specific condtion ke upar stop kar saktey hai.
     4. Ex: if(this.state.counter > 10){ then do something}
     5. Aese use karne se application ki performance increase hogi.
     5. jab kisi component ko render karna ho ya nahi karna ho then use it.



<-------------------------------> Hooks in React Js (V.V.I) <----------------------------->


1. What is Hooks in React Js:
   1. It allow you to use state and other React features without writting a class.

   1. Jab hum class component use kartey hai toh uske under life cycle method ke in-built 
      feature hotey hai like state, life cycle, pure component but Functional component ke under nahi hoti hai usi feature ko use karne ke liye humlog Hooks ka use kartey hai.
  
   2. With Hooks, we can use class component feature in Functional component such as state,
      life cycle, pure component, etc.
   
   3. Hooks are a new features in React 16.8. They let you use state and other 
      React features without writing a class.

1. What is useState in Hooks:
   useState is function which returns a Array with two itmes first is current Data and Second
   is updated Data and jab bhi useState koee value put karengey then called INITIAL DATA.


2. What is useEffect Hook in React Js:
   1. This is Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:

   2. Hooks are the Funtion which "Hook into"  React State and lifecycle features from function com

   3. It does not work inside classes.

   4. Hooks always be used at the top level of the React function. l

   2. If you’re familiar with React class lifecycle methods, you can think of useEffect
      Hook as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount combined.

   3. useEffect Hook are combined componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and   componentWillMount      
 

---> Style type in React Js:
     1. Use the Normal Stylesheet (External CSS).
     2. Style with variable or inline Style (Inline CSS).
     3. CSS with Module.   



2. What is React Fragment:
   1. Fragments is a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
   2. A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements.
   3. Fragment ko as Wrapper use kartey hai.

   --> React Fragment ek pattern hota hai jo multiple elements or multiple component ko
       Handle Karne ke liye.


3. What is Lifting State Up:
   1.jab hum child Componenet se Parent component data send kartey hai then called Lifting state up.
   
   2. In React, sharing state is accomplished by moving it up to the closest common ancestor of the components that need it. This is called “lifting state up”

   3. send the Data Child to Parent Componenet that's called Lifting State Up.

   4. Fragment ke under className nahi bana saktey hai only key le saktey hai.



4. Pure Component:
   pure component ek features hota hai hum just react se import karna hota hai then use kartey hai.



5. What is useMemo Hook in React JS:
   1. Ye application ki performanceko enhance karta hai.
   2. In class Componenet ke under PureComponents use kartey hai same in Functional 
   component ke under humlog useMemo use kartey hai.

   3. Dono ka same kaam hai enahance karna application ko.

   1. The React useMemo Hook returns a memoized value.
   2. Think of memoization as caching a value so that it does not need to be recalculated.
   3. The useMemo Hook only runs when one of its dependencies update.
   4. This can improve performance.
   5. The useMemo and useCallback Hooks are similar.



6. What is Ref in React Js (Class Componenet):
   1. Ref Directly Dom ko manipulate karta hai jabardasti kisi ka color add kar diya
      kisi elements ka property get karliya.

   2. Example form mein value get karni hai validation bhi lagani hai colors bhi change 
    karna hai, focus bhi karni ho then iss case mein we can use.

   
   3.Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method.

   4. When to Use Refs
      There are a few good use cases for refs:
      1. Managing focus, text selection, color apply or media playback.
      2. Triggering imperative animations.
      3. Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.




7. What is useRef Hook in Functional Componenet:
   1. useRef is a Hook jisko hum only we use inside the Functional Componenet.
   2. jab hame style change karna ho, value get karna ho ye sabko handle karne ke liye we use useRef.
   3. ref property hoti hai get karne ke liye.
   4. It can be used to access a DOM element directly.
   5. The useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders.
   6. It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated.



8. forwardRef in Hook in Functional Componenet:
   1. Suppose ek input filed child component mein hai and ek input filed parent component mein
      hai then mujhe DOM mein change karna then we will be use forwardRef
     
   2. React.forwardRef accepts a render function that receives props and ref parameters and 
      returns a React node.
  



---> what is Controlled Component in React JS:
      In React, Controlled Components are those in which form's data is  handled by the component's state.

      It takes its current value through props and makes changes through callbacks like onClick,onChange,



----> what is UnControlled Component in React JS
      1. Uncontrolled Components are those component jiske under input filed ho and wo input
         filed React ke state ke through controlled nhi honi chahiye. 
      
      2. ya toh ye javascript ke through controlled ho rahi hogi ya toh ref ke through.

      3. Uncontrolled Components are the components that are not controlled by the React state
         and they are only handled by the DOM.


----> What is HOC(Higher Order Component):
      1. Higher order component are those Componenet who takes component as a input and  give 
         output as component that's called Higher Order Componenet.
      
      2. A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing   
         component logic. 

      3. A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new  
         component.    




<------------------------------> React Router <------------------------------------> 

1. 6.2.2 --> 6 major update --> 2 --> minor updates ----> 2 patch


1. What is Params:


2. Active Link in Navbar:
   1.Active Link with Class: ans --> (.active{ color: black}) // This simple
   2.Active Link with Style:
   <NavLink style ={({isActive} => {return {colr:isActive?'green':'red'}})}>Home<NavLink/>
  
   3. Navlink mein by default active class hoti hai so we can haldle easily.



3. What is Nested Routing:
   1. Ek Rounting banakar useke under ek routing define karna tha's called nested routing.



4. What is useLocation React Router Hook:
   1. how to pass state inside the useLocation.
   2. what is the Hook of useLocation.
   3. what is hash.
   4. what is params.
   5. How to pass params.

   --> If directly pages ko refresh kartey hai toh key :"default" milta hai.
   --> And If hum ek page se kisi dusre page par jatey hai unique key milta hai automatically.
   --> And If we pass custom key then custom key hi show hoga.


5. What is Protected Route:
   1. Protected route hum log tab lagatey hai jab kuchh hide karni ho data mainly for during Authen..




<---------------------> API In REACT <------------------------>
1. API Call in React:
   1. Get method : Jab data ko Show karna hota hai then we use post method.
   2. post method: Jab data ko store karna hota hai Database ke under then we use post method.
   3. put Method: Jab data ko update karna hota hai then we use put method.
   4. delete method : jab delete karna hota hai then we use delete method.
   5. patch method : ye instruction hoti hai data ko modify karne ke liye

   --> put mathod ka use kartey hai data ko send krne ke liye and uske under data ko 
      modify karne ke liye.

   --> Patch method just ek instruction hoti hai data ko modify karne ke liye.




2. What is postman:
   Postman is tool which use for testing the API Call

   1. 

   --> pre-faleed check karti hai ki hamara server sahi se cal raha hai ki nhi 

3. How To Start CRUD Operation With Fake API:
   1. First create Fake API --> goto on --> https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server
   2. Then Craete a folder in system 
   3. open in Vs Code terminal run commmand --> npx install json-server
   4. then run another command for craete JSON File and start for server ---> npx json-server --watch db.json

   5. then open user hostlink 

<-------------------------------> React Advanced Topic <---------------------------->

1. Context API in React:
   1.Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props
    down manually at every level.
   
   1. Suppose we component tree and i want to share data from one component to other component
      then we can easily share the data using Context. but in nomal way pahle humko parent component mein pass karna hota then phir parent component se uss child component mein
      mein Data share kartey.

      But by using Context API we can easily direct share data from one to other component.



 ---> Inside Context API Two component are important
      1. Provider: Provider Data ko set karta hai ki kya kya Data set Karta hai.
      2. consumer: Comsumers means uss Data ko use karna
      





<------------------------> React Advanced Topic <-------------------------------> 





<--------------------------> Redux in React JS <-------------------------------->

1. What is Redux?
   1. Redux is an open-source JavaScript library which is used to manage application state.

   1. Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating application state, using events call "action"
      
   2. React uses Redux for building the user interface(UI). It was first introduced by Dan Abramov 
      and Andrew Clark in 2015.

   3. It allows React components to read data from a Redux Store, and dispatch Actions to the  Store
      to update data. 
   
   4. Redux itself is a standalone library that can be used with any UI layer or framework.
   5. React redux is an advanced state management library for React.

   --> Redux is just Store or Container where we can store your whole application data.
   --> So we call it to state management.
   --> it dosen't belongs to the component state

   --> Mainly uses of Redux ek component se kisi other Componenet se communicate karane ke liye(VVI). 
    


2. Why we need Redux?
   To mannage state

3. How Redux Work? 


----> File Structures of React Redux:
      Componenets
      Container
      Services: 1. actions
                2. reducers
                3. constants: contants dono filo ko batayega ki action se data jab reducers mein
                              jayega toh koun sa data koun se function mein jana chahiye. 

           
---> Data in React always flow from the parent to child component which makes it unidirectional         
        
             
1. what is Action:
  1. Action are plain JavaScript object that have a type of filed.
  2. Action only tel what to do, but they dont't tell how to do.
  Example : return {
   type: 'Increment',
   payload: num;
  }


2. What is Reducer:
   Reducers are function that take the current state and an function as argument,
   and return a new state result.


3. What is Store:
   1.The Redux store brings Together the state, action and reducers that make up your App.
   2. It's important to note that you will only have a single store in a redux application.
   3. Every Redux store has a single root reducers function.






------> What is Spread Operator:
        const fullName = ["Md", "imtiyaz"];
        const biodata = [1, ...fullName, "sonu", "monu"] 
        
        console.log(fullName); // output --> ['Md', 'imtiyaz']
        console.log(biodata) // Output ---> [1, 'Md', 'imtiyaz', 'sonu', 'monu']
